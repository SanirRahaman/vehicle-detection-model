# Vehicle Detection System using OpenCV and Haar Cascade

This repository contains a simple vehicle detection system implemented in Python using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. The system captures video frames from the default camera and applies a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect vehicles in the scene. Detected vehicles are highlighted with rectangles, and additional information is displayed.

# Features:
* Real-time vehicle detection in a video stream
* Utilizes OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier
* Easy integration with default camera or other video sources
* Simple and efficient implementation

# How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies (cv2).
- Run the vehicle_detection.py script.
<br>Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code for your specific use case.
