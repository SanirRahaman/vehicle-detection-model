# Vehicle Detection System using OpenCV and Haar Cascade

Certainly! Here's a description you can use for the GitHub repository of your vehicle detection model:

Vehicle Detection System using OpenCV and Haar Cascade
This repository contains a simple vehicle detection system implemented in Python using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. The system captures video frames from the default camera and applies a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect vehicles in the scene. Detected vehicles are highlighted with rectangles, and additional information is displayed.
